# debug.py
This is a cog for putting commands to help in development, and all it's commands should only be available in a testing guild, as specified by the `discord:testing_guild:` option in `config/config.yml`.

The available slash commands and what they do will not be listed here, because they are subject to change and intended soley for developers. However, they are also fairly self-explainatory. You can look over them [here](/cogs/debug.py)
