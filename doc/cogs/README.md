# Cogs
Cogs are modules used to organize commands or nextcord methods into multiple python files. They reside in the `cogs/` folder. 

## Example
Cogs are essentially classes, with a few nextcord-specific tweaks. For an example, see [`cogs/catboi.py`](/cogs/catboi.py).

## Documentation
To read more about cogs as a concept, see the [Nextcord Documentation on Cogs](https://docs.nextcord.dev/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html).

## This Section
This section or folder contains markdown files on different Tiramisu cogs and what they do.
