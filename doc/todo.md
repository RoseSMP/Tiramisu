# Feature Parity (and Roadmap) Between various bot solutions
* Proprietary: Fizz wasted money on this one imo, but it gets the job done. current rosebot and fizzv2 bots
* Rosebotv2: Fizz made this one. Good job!
* Tiramisu: Krafter and fizzdev are working on this one, not near complete (or even 50%)
* Red: cool, foss, GPLv3, modular & python (we could even make our own cogs for this one)
